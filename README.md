# well its only missing 2 new features which can be added in 2 seconds if you know anything
# and by taking a look at the source we can see he logs ips at registration & all images to webhooks
# this source is quite funny as he literally creates a new db connection in each file
# and he checks sessions as username so you can just edit your username in session and get access to anyones account ðŸ’€
# just took another look at this, he hashes passwords in MD5 ðŸ’€
